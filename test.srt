1
00:00:00 --> 00:0:07
I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:20
He bathed my heart in love and He wrote my name above

4
00:00:21 --> 00:00:26
And just a little talk with Jesus makes me whole

5
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus

6
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Let us tell Him all about our troubles

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
He will hear our faintest cry

8
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
And He will answer by and by

9
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'

10
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
And you will know a little fire is burnin'

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
Find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

12
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
I may have doubts and fears

13
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
My eyes be filled with tears

14
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night

15
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
I go to him in prayer

16
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
He knows my every care

17
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
And just a little talk with Jesus makes it right

18
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus

19
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
Let us tell Him all about our troubles

20
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
He will hear our faintest cry

21
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
And He will answer by and by

22
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
And when you feel a little prayer wheel turnin'

23
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
And you will know a little fire is burnin'

24
00:00:00 --> 00:00:00
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
