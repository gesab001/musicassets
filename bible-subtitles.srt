1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. Jeremiah 7:23

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But thou shalt say unto them, This [is] a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth. Jeremiah 7:28

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD. Jeremiah 8:14

4
00:03:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, [even] this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. Jeremiah 9:15

5
00:04:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But the LORD [is] the true God, he [is] the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. Jeremiah 10:10

6
00:05:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, [even] they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. Jeremiah 10:11

7
00:06:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed [be] the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant, Jeremiah 11:3

8
00:07:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Which I commanded your fathers in the day [that] I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God: Jeremiah 11:4

9
00:08:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. Jeremiah 11:10

10
00:09:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. Jeremiah 11:12

11
00:10:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For [according to] the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and [according to] the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to [that] shameful thing, [even] altars to burn incense unto Baal. Jeremiah 11:13

12
00:11:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. Jeremiah 13:10

13
00:12:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? Jeremiah 13:12

14
00:13:00,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, [and] make [it] gross darkness. Jeremiah 13:16

15
00:14:00,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place. Jeremiah 14:13

16
00:15:00,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Are there [any] among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? [art] not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these [things.] Jeremiah 14:22

17
00:16:00,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts. Jeremiah 15:16

18
00:17:00,000 --> 00:18:00,000
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. Jeremiah 16:9

19
00:18:00,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what [is] our iniquity? or what [is] our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God? Jeremiah 16:10

20
00:19:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law; Jeremiah 16:11

21
00:20:00,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, [neither] ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour. Jeremiah 16:13

22
00:21:00,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they [are] no gods? Jeremiah 16:20

23
00:22:00,000 --> 00:23:00,000
And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle. Jeremiah 19:3

24
00:23:00,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; Jeremiah 19:4

25
00:24:00,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods. Jeremiah 19:13

26
00:25:00,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words. Jeremiah 19:15

27
00:26:00,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that [are] in your hands, wherewith ye fight [against] the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. Jeremiah 21:4

28
00:27:00,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them. Jeremiah 22:9

29
00:28:00,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD. Jeremiah 23:2

30
00:29:00,000 --> 00:30:00,000
[Am] I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off? Jeremiah 23:23

31
00:30:00,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. Jeremiah 23:36

32
00:31:00,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for [their] good. Jeremiah 24:5

33
00:32:00,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And I will give them an heart to know me, that I [am] the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. Jeremiah 24:7

34
00:33:00,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. Jeremiah 25:6

35
00:34:00,000 --> 00:35:00,000
For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. Jeremiah 25:15

36
00:35:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you. Jeremiah 25:27

37
00:36:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you. Jeremiah 26:13

38
00:37:00,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man [is] not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God. Jeremiah 26:16

39
00:38:00,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; Jeremiah 27:4

40
00:39:00,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain [in] the house of the LORD, and [in] the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; Jeremiah 27:21

41
00:40:00,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. Jeremiah 28:2

42
00:41:00,000 --> 00:42:00,000
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. Jeremiah 28:14

43
00:42:00,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; Jeremiah 29:4

44
00:43:00,000 --> 00:44:00,000
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that [be] in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. Jeremiah 29:8

45
00:44:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; Jeremiah 29:21

46
00:45:00,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that [are] at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, Jeremiah 29:25

47
00:46:00,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book. Jeremiah 30:2

48
00:47:00,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. Jeremiah 30:9

49
00:48:00,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. Jeremiah 30:22

50
00:49:00,000 --> 00:50:00,000
At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. Jeremiah 31:1

51
00:50:00,000 --> 00:51:00,000
For there shall be a day, [that] the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God. Jeremiah 31:6

52
00:51:00,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus;] Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed [to the yoke:] turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou [art] the LORD my God. Jeremiah 31:18

53
00:52:00,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, [and] mountain of holiness. Jeremiah 31:23

54
00:53:00,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. Jeremiah 31:33

55
00:54:00,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. Jeremiah 32:14

56
00:55:00,000 --> 00:56:00,000
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. Jeremiah 32:15

57
00:56:00,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, [and] there is nothing too hard for thee: Jeremiah 32:17

58
00:57:00,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, [is] his name, Jeremiah 32:18

59
00:58:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. Jeremiah 32:25

60
00:59:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Behold, I [am] the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me? Jeremiah 32:27

61
01:00:00,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger. Jeremiah 32:29

62
01:01:00,000 --> 01:02:00,000
And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; Jeremiah 32:36

63
01:02:00,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: Jeremiah 32:38

64
01:03:00,000 --> 01:04:00,000
For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; Jeremiah 33:4

65
01:04:00,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: Jeremiah 34:2

66
01:05:00,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying, Jeremiah 34:13

67
01:06:00,000 --> 01:07:00,000
And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which [was] by the chamber of the princes, which [was] above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: Jeremiah 35:4

68
01:07:00,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD. Jeremiah 35:13

69
01:08:00,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending [them,] saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. Jeremiah 35:15

70
01:09:00,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered. Jeremiah 35:17

71
01:10:00,000 --> 01:11:00,000
And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he hath commanded you: Jeremiah 35:18

72
01:11:00,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever. Jeremiah 35:19

73
01:12:00,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the LORD our God for us. Jeremiah 37:3

74
01:13:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. Jeremiah 37:7

75
01:14:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house: Jeremiah 38:17

76
01:15:00,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be [accomplished] in that day before thee. Jeremiah 39:16

77
01:16:00,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. Jeremiah 40:2

78
01:17:00,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, [even] for all this remnant; (for we are left [but] a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us:) Jeremiah 42:2

79
01:18:00,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do. Jeremiah 42:3

80
01:19:00,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard [you;] behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, [that] whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare [it] unto you; I will keep nothing back from you. Jeremiah 42:4

81
01:20:00,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us. Jeremiah 42:5

82
01:21:00,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Whether [it be] good, or whether [it be] evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God. Jeremiah 42:6

83
01:22:00,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him; Jeremiah 42:9

84
01:23:00,000 --> 01:24:00,000
But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God, Jeremiah 42:13

85
01:24:00,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; Jeremiah 42:15

86
01:25:00,000 --> 01:26:00,000
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. Jeremiah 42:18

87
01:26:00,000 --> 01:27:00,000
For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do [it. ] Jeremiah 42:20

88
01:27:00,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And [now] I have this day declared [it] to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any [thing] for the which he hath sent me unto you. Jeremiah 42:21

89
01:28:00,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And it came to pass, [that] when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, [even] all these words, Jeremiah 43:1

90
01:29:00,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there: Jeremiah 43:2

91
01:30:00,000 --> 01:31:00,000
And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. Jeremiah 43:10

92
01:31:00,000 --> 01:32:00,000
And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. Jeremiah 43:12

93
01:32:00,000 --> 01:33:00,000
He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that [is] in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire. Jeremiah 43:13

94
01:33:00,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and, behold, this day they [are] a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein, Jeremiah 44:2

95
01:34:00,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, [and] to serve other gods, whom they knew not, [neither] they, ye, nor your fathers. Jeremiah 44:3

96
01:35:00,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. Jeremiah 44:5

97
01:36:00,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Wherefore commit ye [this] great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain; Jeremiah 44:7

98
01:37:00,000 --> 01:38:00,000
In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? Jeremiah 44:8

99
01:38:00,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. Jeremiah 44:11

100
01:39:00,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, Jeremiah 44:15

101
01:40:00,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows. Jeremiah 44:25

102
01:41:00,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth. Jeremiah 44:26

103
01:42:00,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; Jeremiah 45:2

104
01:43:00,000 --> 01:44:00,000
For this [is] the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. Jeremiah 46:10

105
01:44:00,000 --> 01:45:00,000
The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings; even Pharaoh, and [all] them that trust in him: Jeremiah 46:25

106
01:45:00,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded [and] taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed. Jeremiah 48:1

107
01:46:00,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. Jeremiah 48:35

108
01:47:00,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. Jeremiah 49:5

109
01:48:00,000 --> 01:49:00,000
In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. Jeremiah 50:4

110
01:49:00,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria. Jeremiah 50:18

111
01:50:00,000 --> 01:51:00,000
The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this [is] the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. Jeremiah 50:25

112
01:51:00,000 --> 01:52:00,000
The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. Jeremiah 50:28

113
01:52:00,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Behold, I [am] against thee, [O thou] most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time [that] I will visit thee. Jeremiah 50:31

114
01:53:00,000 --> 01:54:00,000
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour [cities] thereof, saith the LORD; [so] shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. Jeremiah 50:40

115
01:54:00,000 --> 01:55:00,000
For Israel [hath] not [been] forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel. Jeremiah 51:5

116
01:55:00,000 --> 01:56:00,000
The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God. Jeremiah 51:10

117
01:56:00,000 --> 01:57:00,000
For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon [is] like a threshingfloor, [it is] time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come. Jeremiah 51:33

118
01:57:00,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Because the spoiler is come upon her, [even] upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite. Jeremiah 51:56

119
01:58:00,000 --> 01:59:00,000
Let us lift up our heart with [our] hands unto God in the heavens. Lamentations 3:41

120
01:59:00,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month,] in the fifth [day] of the month, as I [was] among the captives by the river of Chebar, [that] the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. Ezekiel 1:1

121
02:00:00,000 --> 02:01:00,000
For [they are] impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 2:4

122
02:01:00,000 --> 02:02:00,000
And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Ezekiel 3:11

123
02:02:00,000 --> 02:03:00,000
But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they [are] a rebellious house. Ezekiel 3:27

124
02:03:00,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth. Ezekiel 4:14

125
02:04:00,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; This [is] Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries [that are] round about her. Ezekiel 5:5

126
02:05:00,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that [are] round about you, [and] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that [are] round about you; Ezekiel 5:7

127
02:06:00,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, [am] against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations. Ezekiel 5:8

128
02:07:00,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Wherefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish [thee;] neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity. Ezekiel 5:11

129
02:08:00,000 --> 02:09:00,000
And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, [even] I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. Ezekiel 6:3

130
02:09:00,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence. Ezekiel 6:11

131
02:10:00,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land. Ezekiel 7:2

132
02:11:00,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come. Ezekiel 7:5

133
02:12:00,000 --> 02:13:00,000
And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth [month,] in the fifth [day] of the month, [as] I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me. Ezekiel 8:1

134
02:13:00,000 --> 02:14:00,000
And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where [was] the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. Ezekiel 8:3

135
02:14:00,000 --> 02:15:00,000
And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel [was] there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain. Ezekiel 8:4

136
02:15:00,000 --> 02:16:00,000
And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which [had] the writer's inkhorn by his side; Ezekiel 9:3

137
02:16:00,000 --> 02:17:00,000
And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem? Ezekiel 9:8

138
02:17:00,000 --> 02:18:00,000
And the sound of the cherubims' wings was heard [even] to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh. Ezekiel 10:5

139
02:18:00,000 --> 02:19:00,000
And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also [were] beside them, and [every one] stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above. Ezekiel 10:19

140
02:19:00,000 --> 02:20:00,000
This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they [were] the cherubims. Ezekiel 10:20

141
02:20:00,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they [are] the flesh, and this [city is] the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. Ezekiel 11:7

142
02:21:00,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Ye have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 11:8

143
02:22:00,000 --> 02:23:00,000
And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? Ezekiel 11:13

144
02:23:00,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. Ezekiel 11:16

145
02:24:00,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. Ezekiel 11:17

146
02:25:00,000 --> 02:26:00,000
That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. Ezekiel 11:20

147
02:26:00,000 --> 02:27:00,000
But [as for them] whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 11:21

148
02:27:00,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel [was] over them above. Ezekiel 11:22

149
02:28:00,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. Ezekiel 11:24

150
02:29:00,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden [concerneth] the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that [are] among them. Ezekiel 12:10

151
02:30:00,000 --> 02:31:00,000
And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, [and] of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein. Ezekiel 12:19

152
02:31:00,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision. Ezekiel 12:23

153
02:32:00,000 --> 02:33:00,000
For I [am] the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 12:25

154
02:33:00,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 12:28

155
02:34:00,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing! Ezekiel 13:3

156
02:35:00,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I [am] against you, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 13:8

157
02:36:00,000 --> 02:37:00,000
And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 13:9

158
02:37:00,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend [it] with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in [my] fury to consume [it. ] Ezekiel 13:13

159
02:38:00,000 --> 02:39:00,000
[To wit,] the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and [there is] no peace, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 13:16

160
02:39:00,000 --> 02:40:00,000
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the [women] that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive [that come] unto you? Ezekiel 13:18

161
02:40:00,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make [them] fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, [even] the souls that ye hunt to make [them] fly. Ezekiel 13:20

162
02:41:00,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols; Ezekiel 14:4

163
02:42:00,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn [yourselves] from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations. Ezekiel 14:6

164
02:43:00,000 --> 02:44:00,000
That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 14:11

165
02:44:00,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver [but] their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 14:14

166
02:45:00,000 --> 02:46:00,000
[Though] these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate. Ezekiel 14:16

167
02:46:00,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Though these three men [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves. Ezekiel 14:18

168
02:47:00,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Though Noah, Daniel, and Job, [were] in it, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall [but] deliver their own souls by their righteousness. Ezekiel 14:20

169
02:48:00,000 --> 02:49:00,000
For thus saith the Lord GOD; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast? Ezekiel 14:21

170
02:49:00,000 --> 02:50:00,000
And they shall comfort you, when ye see their ways and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 14:23

171
02:50:00,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Ezekiel 15:6

172
02:51:00,000 --> 02:52:00,000
And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 15:8

173
02:52:00,000 --> 02:53:00,000
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity [is] of the land of Canaan; thy father [was] an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite. Ezekiel 16:3

174
02:53:00,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time [was] the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine. Ezekiel 16:8

175
02:54:00,000 --> 02:55:00,000
And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for it [was] perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 16:14

176
02:55:00,000 --> 02:56:00,000
My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey, [wherewith] I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour: and [thus] it was, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 16:19

177
02:56:00,000 --> 02:57:00,000
And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord GOD;) Ezekiel 16:23

178
02:57:00,000 --> 02:58:00,000
How weak is thine heart, saith the Lord GOD, seeing thou doest all these [things,] the work of an imperious whorish woman; Ezekiel 16:30

179
02:58:00,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out, and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy children, which thou didst give unto them; Ezekiel 16:36

180
02:59:00,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these [things;] behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon [thine] head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations. Ezekiel 16:43

181
03:00:00,000 --> 03:01:00,000
[As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters. Ezekiel 16:48

182
03:01:00,000 --> 03:02:00,000
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. Ezekiel 16:59

183
03:02:00,000 --> 03:03:00,000
That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 16:63

184
03:03:00,000 --> 03:04:00,000
And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar: Ezekiel 17:3

185
03:04:00,000 --> 03:05:00,000
Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof. Ezekiel 17:9

186
03:05:00,000 --> 03:06:00,000
As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place [where] the king [dwelleth] that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, [even] with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die. Ezekiel 17:16

187
03:06:00,000 --> 03:07:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; [As] I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head. Ezekiel 17:19

188
03:07:00,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set [it;] I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant [it] upon an high mountain and eminent: Ezekiel 17:22

189
03:08:00,000 --> 03:09:00,000
[As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have [occasion] any more to use this proverb in Israel. Ezekiel 18:3

190
03:09:00,000 --> 03:10:00,000
Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he [is] just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 18:9

191
03:10:00,000 --> 03:11:00,000
Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: [and] not that he should return from his ways, and live? Ezekiel 18:23

192
03:11:00,000 --> 03:12:00,000
Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn [yourselves] from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Ezekiel 18:30

193
03:12:00,000 --> 03:13:00,000
For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn [yourselves,] and live ye. Ezekiel 18:32

194
03:13:00,000 --> 03:14:00,000
Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to enquire of me? [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you. Ezekiel 20:3

195
03:14:00,000 --> 03:15:00,000
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I [am] the LORD your God; Ezekiel 20:5

196
03:15:00,000 --> 03:16:00,000
Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God. Ezekiel 20:7

197
03:16:00,000 --> 03:17:00,000
I [am] the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; Ezekiel 20:19

198
03:17:00,000 --> 03:18:00,000
And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I [am] the LORD your God. Ezekiel 20:20

199
03:18:00,000 --> 03:19:00,000
Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me. Ezekiel 20:27

200
03:19:00,000 --> 03:20:00,000
Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations? Ezekiel 20:30

201
03:20:00,000 --> 03:21:00,000
For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you. Ezekiel 20:31

202
03:21:00,000 --> 03:22:00,000
[As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you: Ezekiel 20:33

203
03:22:00,000 --> 03:23:00,000
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 20:36

204
03:23:00,000 --> 03:24:00,000
As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter [also,] if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols. Ezekiel 20:39

205
03:24:00,000 --> 03:25:00,000
For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. Ezekiel 20:40

206
03:25:00,000 --> 03:26:00,000
And ye shall know that I [am] the LORD, when I have wrought with you for my name's sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 20:44

207
03:26:00,000 --> 03:27:00,000
And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein. Ezekiel 20:47

208
03:27:00,000 --> 03:28:00,000
Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Doth he not speak parables? Ezekiel 20:49

209
03:28:00,000 --> 03:29:00,000
And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak [as] water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 21:7

210
03:29:00,000 --> 03:30:00,000
Because [it is] a trial, and what if [the sword] contemn even the rod? it shall be no [more,] saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 21:13

211
03:30:00,000 --> 03:31:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, [I say,] that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. Ezekiel 21:24

212
03:31:00,000 --> 03:32:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this [shall] not [be] the same: exalt [him that is] low, and abase [him that is] high. Ezekiel 21:26

213
03:32:00,000 --> 03:33:00,000
And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword [is] drawn: for the slaughter [it is] furbished, to consume because of the glittering: Ezekiel 21:28

214
03:33:00,000 --> 03:34:00,000
Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself. Ezekiel 22:3

215
03:34:00,000 --> 03:35:00,000
In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 22:12

216
03:35:00,000 --> 03:36:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem. Ezekiel 22:19

217
03:36:00,000 --> 03:37:00,000
And her prophets have daubed them with untempered [morter,] seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken. Ezekiel 22:28

218
03:37:00,000 --> 03:38:00,000
Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 22:31

219
03:38:00,000 --> 03:39:00,000
Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side; Ezekiel 23:22

220
03:39:00,000 --> 03:40:00,000
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand [of them] whom thou hatest, into the hand [of them] from whom thy mind is alienated: Ezekiel 23:28

221
03:40:00,000 --> 03:41:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it containeth much. Ezekiel 23:32

222
03:41:00,000 --> 03:42:00,000
Thou shalt even drink it and suck [it] out, and thou shalt break the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken [it,] saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 23:34

223
03:42:00,000 --> 03:43:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms. Ezekiel 23:35

224
03:43:00,000 --> 03:44:00,000
For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled. Ezekiel 23:46

225
03:44:00,000 --> 03:45:00,000
And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 23:49

226
03:45:00,000 --> 03:46:00,000
And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set [it] on, and also pour water into it: Ezekiel 24:3

227
03:46:00,000 --> 03:47:00,000
Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum [is] not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall up on it. Ezekiel 24:6

228
03:47:00,000 --> 03:48:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great. Ezekiel 24:9

229
03:48:00,000 --> 03:49:00,000
I the LORD have spoken [it:] it shall come to pass, and I will do [it;] I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 24:14

230
03:49:00,000 --> 03:50:00,000
Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword. Ezekiel 24:21

231
03:50:00,000 --> 03:51:00,000
Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done shall ye do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I [am] the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 24:24

232
03:51:00,000 --> 03:52:00,000
And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; Ezekiel 25:3

233
03:52:00,000 --> 03:53:00,000
For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped [thine] hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel; Ezekiel 25:6

234
03:53:00,000 --> 03:54:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah [is] like unto all the heathen; Ezekiel 25:8

235
03:54:00,000 --> 03:55:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; Ezekiel 25:12

236
03:55:00,000 --> 03:56:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. Ezekiel 25:13

237
03:56:00,000 --> 03:57:00,000
And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD. Ezekiel 25:14

238
03:57:00,000 --> 03:58:00,000
Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy [it] for the old hatred; Ezekiel 25:15

239
03:58:00,000 --> 03:59:00,000
Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast. Ezekiel 25:16
